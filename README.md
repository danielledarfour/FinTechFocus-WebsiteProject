# Prototype Netflix Recommender

This project is a website that allows the user to select their preferred Netflix movie/show category and receive four recommendations in that category.
- Utilized Git for version control, Flask for backend logic, Bootstrap v5.3 for responsive UI, HTML/CSS for frontend
design, and Python for backend scripting
- Developed a seamless webpage where users input their name and select a preferred Netflix category from a
Bootstrap dropdown menu
- Employed Python to manage data, crafting individual lists for each of the nine categories, with four dictionaries per
list containing title, image URL, and synopsis
- Engineered a function that utilizes Flask to retrieve and organize recommendation details for the chosen category,
then seamlessly integrated the data into designated sections within the frontend HTML
- Created dynamic frontend with CSS, enabling smooth transitions, element alignments, animations, fonts, colors,
and hover effects, delivering an intuitive and visually pleasing interface
